    <h1>Makemake</h1>
  </header>
  <article>
    <p>
      Makemake is a large dwarf planet located in the Kuiper Belt, a distant region of the Solar System beyond Neptune filled with icy bodies. Discovered in March 2005 by a team led by Mike Brown, Makemake is one of the brightest known trans-Neptunian objects and is the second brightest Kuiper Belt object after Pluto.
    </p>
    <p>
      Makemake has a diameter of about 1,430 kilometers (890 miles), making it smaller than Pluto and Eris but still one of the largest objects in the Kuiper Belt. Its orbit is moderately elliptical and inclined, taking about 305 Earth years to complete one trip around the Sun. Makemake’s distance from the Sun ranges from about 38.5 to 53 AU (astronomical units).
    </p>
    <p>
      The surface of Makemake is extremely cold, with temperatures estimated to be around -239°C (-398°F). Its surface is covered with frozen methane, ethane, and possibly nitrogen ices, giving it a reddish-brown color. The presence of methane ice is similar to Pluto and suggests that Makemake has a thin, transient atmosphere that may appear when it is closest to the Sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2016, astronomers discovered a small moon orbiting Makemake, provisionally designated S/2015 (136472) 1, and nicknamed MK2. The moon is estimated to be about 175 kilometers (109 miles) in diameter and orbits Makemake at a distance of about 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles). The discovery of MK2 has helped scientists better estimate Makemake’s mass and density.
    </p>
    <p>
      Makemake is named after the creator god of the Rapa Nui people of Easter Island, reflecting the tradition of naming Kuiper Belt objects after mythological figures. The name was chosen to honor the culture of Easter Island, where the discovery was announced near the time of the island’s annual festival.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Moon:</strong> One known moon (MK2, discovered in 2016)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Suitability for Life:</strong> There is no evidence for life on Makemake. Its extremely cold temperatures, lack of a substantial atmosphere, and distance from the Sun make it inhospitable to life as we know it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Exploration:</strong> No spacecraft has visited Makemake. It remains a target of interest for future missions, as studying Makemake and its moon could provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of the outer Solar System.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Makemake was one of the reasons the International Astronomical Union created the "dwarf planet" category in 2006, along with Eris and Haumea.
