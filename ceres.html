    <h1>Ceres</h1>
  </header>
  <article>
    <p>
      Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and is classified as both a dwarf planet and an asteroid. Discovered in 1801 by Giuseppe Piazzi, it was the first object found in the asteroid belt and is the only dwarf planet located in the inner Solar System.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ceres has a diameter of about 940 kilometers (584 miles), making it about a quarter the size of the Moon. Its nearly spherical shape is due to its own gravity, distinguishing it from most smaller, irregularly shaped asteroids. Ceres makes up about a third of the mass of the entire asteroid belt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surface of Ceres is a mixture of water ice, hydrated minerals such as clays and carbonates, and dark, carbon-rich compounds. Bright spots observed on its surface, especially in the Occator Crater, are deposits of sodium carbonate and other salts, likely left behind by briny water that seeped up from the interior and evaporated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidence from NASA's Dawn spacecraft suggests that Ceres may have a subsurface ocean or pockets of briny liquid water beneath its icy crust. This raises the possibility of cryovolcanism—volcanoes that erupt salty water or slush instead of molten rock. The presence of organic molecules and water ice makes Ceres a key target in the search for potential habitability in the Solar System.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ceres has a very thin atmosphere, possibly created by water vapor outgassing from its surface or subsurface. The surface temperature varies from about -106°C to -38°C (-159°F to -36°F), depending on location and sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Moons:</strong> None. Ceres does not have any known natural satellites.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Suitability for Life:</strong> While no life has been detected, the possible presence of subsurface liquid water and organic compounds makes Ceres a candidate for future habitability studies. Its unique chemistry and geology provide clues about the early Solar System and the distribution of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Exploration:</strong> Ceres was visited by NASA's Dawn spacecraft from 2015 to 2018, which orbited and mapped its surface in detail. Dawn's discoveries transformed our understanding of Ceres, revealing its complex geology, bright spots, and evidence for water-related processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Ceres is named after the Roman goddess of agriculture and grain crops. Its symbol is a sickle, representing the goddess.
