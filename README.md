# solar-system-explorer
This is for all the space enthusiasts out there for people like me. It is something I wanted to do since a long time cause I always wanted to contribute my knowledge in the COmputer Science field to the Astronomy
And this is one small project from my side which includes information about solar system and its planets along with the space missions launched with a latest news option that will be kept uptodate.
ALong with this, I have also included about information about our planets and especially a detailed information about the dwarf planets which many of us are not even aware of.
While there is a page dedicated to the Space agencies like ISRO,NASA,JAXA and ESA along with their latest news.
Hope you have like this and yes suggestions and reviews are most welcomed.
Thank you for taking out your time.
